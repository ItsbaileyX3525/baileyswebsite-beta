                per the title name, is a remastered version of my 
                first game called "Sus clicker", sus clicker was a 
                little project I worked on during my time at 
                school, using the unity game engine. I would pump 
                out updates every week or so but due to the fact I 
                had only just started coding, my skills were very 
                limited, causing the game to become a terrible 
                mess, this lead to me creating the "big change" 
                will broke the balance of the entire game making 
                it beatable in like 12 minutes, undesirable. So 
                after about 6 months I found out about godot 
                engine and that's when my work begun (after I had 
                already made a few games with godot). The game 
                was supposed to be a little remaster, having 
                some of the shops from the original and all the 
                same features, and it still does, but the game 
                has a lot more new features, such as new shops, 
                new prestige systems and none of the old annoying 
                bugs, numbers in this game can also reach 
                infinity beacause of the godot big numbers 
                addon! This game is my pride and joy and I 
                love it dearly and if you play it, I hope you 
                love it too!</p>

                never fix them because of two reasons: 1. They are

                using a new game engine called "taptapir" which was developed by the amazing person known as <a class="text-[#ff8c69]" href="https://pokepetter.github.io/portfolio/">"Pokepetter"</a>.
                Let's talk about platformer 1.0 later. Platformer 
                2.0 helped me learn a lot about the godot engine 
                and other things that you can expect to see in game 
                engines such as raycasting and lighting, which 
                prior I had no idea how to use as it was too 
                confusing. Without platformer 2.0 as my stepping 
                stones I probably wouldn't have touched godot as I 
                was already dubious about the engine already. I 
                loved ursina!

              support for building to apk) and me and Ryan saw this 
              as a chance to create a fun mobile and desktop game 
              using a brand new engine on the block! Due to the 
              fact that the engine had literally just came out 
              there was limited features so we had to create 
              collision detection and all of that by ourselves 
              which was very hard considering we had only just 
              started our coding journey like a year prior and 
              we weren't very smart haha. But using a very jank 
              system we created all of the collison and needed 
              items! I really recommend you try the game out and 
              see if its good! Originallly you would've wanted to 
              change your refresh rate to 60hz otherwise the game 
              would run weirdly (we didnt know about delta time and 
              such at that point.) I have tried my best to fix it 
              and it should run well no matter your refresh

              But I remember having a lot of fun creating this 
              game, I would make it exclusivly at school on the 
              breaks, where me and a few friends would work on it 
              together (I would code). Overall the most fun game 
              I've ever created. Thank you all.

              I don't exactly remember what went on when I was 
              making this but it was during the creation of 
              nextbots, around near the end of development or 
              at the end of development, I created amogus 
              clicker because I liked cookie clicker and 
              amogus was hit game at the time, combine them 
              together and you get sus clicker, built with ursina 
              and terrible UI. This sus clicker kick started all 
              the future makings of sus clicker. So a timeline for 
              you: Amogus clicker -> Amogus clicker revisited -> 
              Sus clicker android -> Sus clicker remastered (current)
