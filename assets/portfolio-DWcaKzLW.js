One of the first times I started coding was in 2018 when I was messing around with roblox and found a "game" called Roblox Studio, on there I would build very simple games and have a blast doing so, I even posted some <a class="text-[#ff8c69]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lltJLW97GLY" target="_blank">videos</a> of it on my youtube channel!</p><br><p>This, however, was short-lived due to the fact that my mind just couldn't comprend the immesive coding and I just gave up, but that isn't where the story ends, no no no. About 4 years later I got kicked out of my school, <a class="text-[#ff8c69]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSsVM776Xes" target="_blank">this is the background music to the song</a> (for legal reaons I can't link the real song.) Anyways, went I went to the local PRU one of the teachers that specialised in coding (he wasn't really the best lol) but he let us go on scratch and create a <a class="text-[#ff8c69]" href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/678586533/" target="_blank">simple game</a> and eventually it evolved into a big school project that I worked on during breaks, I had loads of fun creating it. It was not a good game however, like it was terrible.</p><br><p>After creating that scratch game I kind of went silent again in the coding aspect as I got bored of scratch as it was very limited. After getting back into mainstream schools I picked my subjects (I was in year 10 at this point) and computer scienece was one of them, in one of our lessons our teacher taught us about "Python" and during that lesson is when I fell in love with coding. After the lesson it was break so I asked if I could stay behind to learn about python on the computers some more and she said yes (Thank god otherwise I would not have ever done coding I can say that with 100% certainty) and I learned about "Ursina" game engine and started creating "Nextbots".</p><br><p>After that I would work on games and my chatroom website (99% AI so I do not want to call it mine at all really) until I graduated secondary school and went to college. At this point I had been coding daily for 2 years and college is when I got serious learning about brainfuck, C, C#, Java, Javascript, CSS, HTML and much more! Pumping out loads of games and loads of websites. Which is where I am at currently, on summer break making a website ready for year 2 as it focuses on website creation!</p><br><p>Thank you for reading this all and make sure to check out ./Videos/FurnessCollege.webm to see a promotional video about my college!</p></data>`)}],["README.md",()=>{n('<h1 id="hi-i-m-bailey-">Hi, I&#39;m Bailey!</h1><p>I enjoy coding, playing games and various other things!
